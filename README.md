# inits

A simple init system for Node.js.
Manages initialization tasks, and optionally also shutdown tasks.
Useful to simplify initialization of complex systems
with asynchronous tasks.

## Installation

Simply run:

```
npm install inits
```

Or add `inits` to your `package.json`:

```
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "inits": "*",
    ...
},
```

and run `npm install`.

## Lifecycle of a System

There are four distinct phases in `inits`:

* init,
* start,
* stop,
* and finish.

They are intended to be symmetric:
if a certain capability is open in `init`
it should be closed in `finish`,
and whatever starts in `start`
should be stopped in (surprise!) `stop`.

### Init Phase

Initialization tasks, such as connecting to the database.
The init system will make sure that all `require`'d code files have been loaded
before starting this phase.

### Start Phase

Tasks to start the system, such as starting a web server.
These run after all `init` tasks have finished.

### Stop Phase

Tasks to stop the system, such as stopping any open servers.
These run when the system initiates shutdown: either by a signal
(SIGTERM, SIGKILL or control-C) or by an uncaught exception
or an error.

### Finish Phase

Final shutdown tasks, such as disconnecting from the database:
whatever needs to be done before the system definitely closes down.

### Callbacks

All callbacks passed to the four phases must receive another callback
of the form `function(error)` following the Node.js convention,
and chain-call them at the end with either an error
or a falsy value (`null`, `undefined`, nothing) to signal success.

Example:

```
inits.init(function(next)
{
    DatabaseDriver.connect(url, function(error, connected)
    {
        if (error)
        {
            return next(error);
        }
        db = connected;
        next(null);
    });
});
```

Note how the callback `next` is invoked before the function ends;
this allows `inits` to run asynchronous tasks,
and to regain execution and run any other callbacks.

If your callback is synchronous, simply invoke the callback at the end:

```
inits.finish(function(next)
{
    db.close();
    next(null);
});
```

Note: the choice of callback names is not important,
we have used `next` here but `callback` elsewhere;
whatever is clearer to you.

### No Dependencies

There is no dependency management in `inits`.
This is deliberate; it would be much more complex
for something that is not generally needed.
If you need a certain task to run before another one,
just run them in sequence.

### Other Lifecycles

Sometimes four phases are not enough.
`inits` might be designed to support custom phases in the future
if there is interest; just create an issue if you are interested,
or even better, send a pull request.

## API

The following functions and events are available.

### inits.init(callback)

Add a callback to the initialization.

### inits.start(callback)

Add a callback to be called when starting (after initialization).

### inits.stop(callback)

Add a callback to be called when stopping.

### inits.finish(callback)

Add a callback to be called before finishing.

### inits.standalone(callback)

Set a callback as a standalone task.
Useful when your script consists solely of a task
that must run after startup, followed by shutdown.

### Event: 'ready'

Sent when initialization has finished and the system is ready.

### Event: 'end'

Sent after the system has finished and is about to exit.
Can be used e.g. to call `process.exit()` (which `inits` doesn't do by itself).

### Event: 'error'

Sent when there is an error in any phase.

## Options

To configure `inits` you can set some attributes in `inits.options`
that will modify how the init system behaves.

### catchErrors

If set to `true` (or any other truthy value),
`inits` will catch uncaught exceptions and errors
and shutdown automatically when any of those happens.
Default: `true`.

### catchSignals

If set to `true` (or any other truthy value),
`inits` will intercept SIGTERM and SIGKILL (e.g. control-C) signals
and shutdown when one of them is received.
Default: `true`.

### showErrors

If set to `true` (or any other truthy value),
`inits` will show a log message for every error.
Default: `true`.

## Full example

How to make a web server that connects to a MongoDB database.
We will hook database startup to the `init` phase,
and server start to the `start` phase.
On `stop` we stop the server,
and on `finish` we close the connection to the database.

``` javascript
var inits = require('inits');
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
var mongodb = require('mongodb');
var http = require('http');

var db;

inits.init(function(callback)
{
    MongoClient.connect(url, function(error, connected)
    {
        if (error)
        {
            return callback(error);
        }
        db = connected;
        callback(null);
    });
});
inits.start(function(callback)
{
    server = http.createServer(listener);
    server.on('error', function(error)
    {
        return callback(error);
    });
    server.on('listening', function()
    {
        callback(null);
    });
});
inits.stop(function(callback)
{
    server.close(callback);
});
inits.finish(function(callback)
{
    db.close();
    callback(null);
});
```
