# inits

A simple init system for Node.js.
Manages initialization tasks, and optionally also shutdown tasks.
Useful to simplify initialization of complex systems.

## Installation

Simply run:

```
npm install inits
```

Or add `inits` to your `package.json`:

```
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "inits": "*",
    ...
},
```

and run `npm install`.

## Phases

There are four distinct phases in `inits`:

* init
* start
* stop
* finish

## API

The following functions and events are available.

### inits.init(callback)

Add a callback to the initialization.

### inits.start(callback)

Add a callback to be called when starting (after initialization).

### inits.stop(callback)

Add a callback to be called when stopping.

### inits.finish(callback)

Add a callback to be called before finishing.

### inits.standalone(callback)

Set a callback as a standalone task.
Useful when your script consists solely of a task
that must run after startup, followed by shutdown.

### Event: 'ready'

Sent when initialization has finished and the system is ready.

### Event: 'end'

Sent after the system has finished and is about to exit.
Can be used e.g. to call `process.exit()` (which `inits` doesn't do by itself).

### Event: 'error'

Sent when there is an error in any phase.

## Full example

How to make a web server that connects to a MongoDB database.
We will hook database startup to the `init` phase,
and server start to the `start` phase.
On `stop` we stop the server,
and on `finish` we close the connection to the database.

``` javascript
var inits = require('inits');
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
var mongodb = require('mongodb');
var http = require('http');

var db;

inits.init(function(callback)
{
    MongoClient.connect(url, function(error, connected)
    {
        if (error)
        {
            return callback(error);
        }
        db = connected;
        callback(null);
    });
});
inits.start(function(callback)
{
    server = http.createServer(listener);
    server.on('error', function(error)
    {
        return callback(error);
    });
    server.on('listening', function()
    {
        callback(null);
    });
});
inits.stop(function(callback)
{
    server.close(callback);
});
inits.finish(function(callback)
{
    db.close();
    callback(null);
});
```
